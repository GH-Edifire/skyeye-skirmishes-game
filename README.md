# skyeye-skirmishes-game
Project for university. Top-down 2D real time strategy game, created with Java with LibGDX framework in IntelliJ IDEA. Implements basic enemy AI, GUI, battle system, and camera panning + zoom on the battlefield map. Used some outside tools such as "Tiled" to create the background maps and "TexturePacker" to create spritesheets for the game.

Development halted since class has ended. May come back to remake the game with more features/3D engine another time as a passion project.
