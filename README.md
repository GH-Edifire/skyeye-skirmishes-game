# skyeye-skirmishes-game
Project for university. Top-down 2D real time strategy game, created with Java with LibGDX framework in IntelliJ IDEA. Implements basic enemy AI, GUI, battle system, and camera panning + zoom on the battlefield map. Used some outside tools such as "Tiled" to create the background maps and "TexturePacker" to create spritesheets for the game.

Development halted since class has ended. May come back to remake the game with more features/3D engine another time as a passion project.

One big optimization that I see now is that I put all the unit types as separate objects that I just copy-pasted code in after I finished one of the units. Instead, I should have created one "Unit" class and have the others inherit from it. Would have saved me a lot of trouble.
